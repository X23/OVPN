OVPN
====
Allows for the easy creation of streamlined ovpn files - ones where all certificates and keys are contained into one file. These are used where the separate files cannot be used for example OpenVPN on iOS.

The script automatically generates the file with UDP enabled as well as compression and all traffic to be tunnelled through.

 -s  sets the location of the easy-rsa keys and certificates e.g. /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
</code>
